EXERLOG

To run, run "node index.js" in main directory and go to localhost:3000 in your browser, this is the final version of the project.

Login with username "labeln" if you want to avoid having to enter a bunch of data!!!

Data collections are included as JSONS on canvas (exer is the one you want, login just has some usernames but you may still want to add them in.)
